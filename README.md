## Requirements

- Python 3.8+ (recomended)
- The following Python packages:
  - `certifi==2024.6.2`
  - `charset-normalizer==3.3.2`
  - `colorama==0.4.6`
  - `idna==3.7`
  - `requests==2.32.3`
  - `urllib3==2.2.1`
  - `websockets==12.0`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jawikas/pixelverse-auto-battle.git
    cd pixelverse-auto-battle
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Configure the bot by editing or create the `config.json` file with your own credentials:
    ```json
   {
       "secret": "", "tgId": "",
       "initData": "YourQuery_id=xxxxisHere",
       "upgrade_pets": false,
       "min_hit_speed": 0.09,
       "max_hit_speed": 0.111
   }
    ```
( Update 7/7/2024 ) reduce the need for "tg id" and "secret" because now it is automatically executed in Battle.py, and you only need to enter the Query ID into config.json

Please Leave "tg id" and "secret" blank

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```
